We'll begin by discussing what React is and why it was created, touching on its component-based architecture and how it differs from traditional web development approaches. I’ll walk you through setting up a React development environment using Create React App, which simplifies the initial setup with zero configuration. You’ll learn how to create your first React component, render it to the DOM, and manage its state using hooks like useState. We’ll also explore JSX, the syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript, making your UI code more intuitive and declarative. Additionally, I’ll introduce the concept of props for passing data between components, and how this promotes reusability and modularity in your code. By the end of this guide, you’ll have built a simple, functioning React application, giving you a strong foundation to explore more advanced topics like state management, routing, and performance optimization.\"],\n      readingTime: \"6 min\",\n      date: \"2025-02-01\"\n    }, {\n      slug: \"understanding-component-lifecycle\",\n      title: \"Understanding Component Lifecycle in React\",\n      author: \"Mohammad Rajabi\",\n      role: \"React developer\",\n      cover: \"/certs/lifecycle-hero.png\",\n      excerpt: \"React components are the building blocks of any React application, and understanding their lifecycle is crucial for writing effective and efficient code.

Each of these phases contains several lifecycle methods, such as constructor, render, componentDidMount, shouldComponentUpdate, and componentWillUnmount, each serving a specific purpose. I’ll explain how these methods allow you to execute code at particular moments in a component’s life, such as fetching data from an API when the component is first rendered or cleaning up resources before the component is destroyed. We’ll also discuss how the introduction of React hooks has changed the way we handle component lifecycles, with hooks like useEffectreplacing many of the traditional lifecycle methods. Through practical examples, I’ll demonstrate how to use these methods and hooks to solve common problems, like avoiding unnecessary re-renders, handling side effects, and optimizing performance. By the end of this post, you’ll have a comprehensive understanding of the React component lifecycle and how to leverage it to build dynamic, responsive, and high-performing applications.\"],\n      readingTime: \"7 min\",\n      date: \"2025-02-03\"\n    }, {\n      slug: \"Building-Responsive-Layouts-with-CSS-Grid-and-Flexboxe\",\n      title: \"Building Responsive Layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox\",\n      author: \"Mohammad Rajabi\",\n      role: \"React developer\",\n      cover: \"/certs/building-responsive.png\",\n      excerpt: \"In today’s multi-device world, creating responsive layouts is a fundamental skill for any frontend developer.

Both Flexbox and CSS Grid offer distinct advantages for different types of layouts, and understanding how to use them together can greatly enhance the responsiveness and flexibility of your designs. We’ll begin by covering the basics of Flexbox, which excels at creating one-dimensional layouts—perfect for aligning items in a row or column. You’ll learn how to use Flexbox properties like justify-content, align-items, and flex-directionto control the alignment, spacing, and flow of elements within a container. Next, we’ll dive into CSS Grid, a more advanced layout system that allows you to create two-dimensional grid-based layouts with ease. I’ll show you how to define grid tracks, place items on the grid, and use powerful features like grid-template-areasand auto-fitto create complex, yet responsive layouts. Throughout the post, we’ll build a real-world example, such as a responsive dashboard or a gallery, where you can see Flexbox and CSS Grid working in tandem to create a seamless, adaptive design. We’ll also cover important considerations for mobile-first design and how to use media queries in conjunction with these layout modules to ensure your designs work on any screen size.

We'll begin by discussing what React is and why it was created, touching on its component-based architecture and how it differs from traditional web development approaches. I’ll walk you through setting up a React development environment using Create React App, which simplifies the initial setup with zero configuration. You’ll learn how to create your first React component, render it to the DOM, and manage its state using hooks like useState. We’ll also explore JSX, the syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript, making your UI code more intuitive and declarative. Additionally, I’ll introduce the concept of props for passing data between components, and how this promotes reusability and modularity in your code. By the end of this guide, you’ll have built a simple, functioning React application, giving you a strong foundation to explore more advanced topics like state management, routing, and performance optimization.\",\r\n        ],\r\n        readingTime: \"6 min\",\r\n        date: \"2025-02-01\",\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        slug: \"understanding-component-lifecycle\",\r\n        title: \"Understanding Component Lifecycle in React\",\r\n        author: \"Mohammad Rajabi\",\r\n        role: \"React developer\",\r\n        cover: \"/certs/lifecycle-hero.png\",\r\n        excerpt:\r\n          \"React components are the building blocks of any React application, and understanding their lifecycle is crucial for writing effective and efficient code.

I’ll explain how these methods allow you to execute code at particular moments in a component’s life, such as fetching data from an API when the component is first rendered or cleaning up resources before the component is destroyed. We’ll also discuss how the introduction of React hooks has changed the way we handle component lifecycles, with hooks like useEffectreplacing many of the traditional lifecycle methods. Through practical examples, I’ll demonstrate how to use these methods and hooks to solve common problems, like avoiding unnecessary re-renders, handling side effects, and optimizing performance.

Both Flexbox and CSS Grid offer distinct advantages for different types of layouts, and understanding how to use them together can greatly enhance the responsiveness and flexibility of your designs. We’ll begin by covering the basics of Flexbox, which excels at creating one-dimensional layouts—perfect for aligning items in a row or column. You’ll learn how to use Flexbox properties like justify-content, align-items, and flex-directionto control the alignment, spacing, and flow of elements within a container. Next, we’ll dive into CSS Grid, a more advanced layout system that allows you to create two-dimensional grid-based layouts with ease. I’ll show you how to define grid tracks, place items on the grid, and use powerful features like grid-template-areasand auto-fitto create complex, yet responsive layouts. Throughout the post, we’ll build a real-world example, such as a responsive dashboard or a gallery, where you can see Flexbox and CSS Grid working in tandem to create a seamless, adaptive design. We’ll also cover important considerations for mobile-first design and how to use media queries in conjunction with these layout modules to ensure your designs work on any screen size.
